                                Mining for bitcoin generates substantial electronic waste that 
                                "represents a growing threat to the environment", according to a recent study. 
                                A co-author of the report told AFP on Friday that the average life cycle of the powerful 
                                computers used to unearth the units of the world's leading cryptocurrency was only 1.3 years.

                                the definitive protocol for the return of the public will state that it will be necessary for fans to 
                                prove that they are vaccinated, at least with a dose of the inoculant against covid-19.

                                the early hours of this Monday in the town of Villa Celina, in the Buenos Aires district of La Matanza. The victim had

                                and once there they found the body of a 20-year-old boy, with a knife stuck in his chest.
